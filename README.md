# Instacart-Python-Analysis
Python notebooks for the Instacart project, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations.


## Portfolio Highlights
- ✅ 12 Jupyter notebooks covering all bootcamp tasks
- ✅ Data cleaning, wrangling, and preparation
- ✅ Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations
- ✅ Final report delivered to the client in Excel

## Project Overview
This repository contains Python notebooks from the Instacart project. The goal was to analyze customer, product, and order data to provide actionable insights.

Key tasks include:
- Data cleaning and wrangling of original CSV datasets
- Exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Visualizations to identify trends, popular products, and customer behavior
- Preparation of a final report for client delivery

## Dataset
- Original data provided: `customers.csv`, `departments.csv`, `orders_products_prior.csv`, `orders.csv`, `products.csv`
- Prepared data files contain cleaned and processed versions in CSV and PKL formats

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming and data manipulation with Pandas
- Jupyter notebook documentation and reproducible workflows
- Data visualization and reporting
- Organizing code and project files for clarity
