## Project Overview
This repository contains the Python work for the Instacart project. The goal was to perform **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** on the Instacart dataset to provide actionable insights.

Key tasks include:  
- Data wrangling and preparation for analysis  
- Exploratory data analysis using Jupyter notebooks  
- Visualizations to highlight trends and insights  
- Delivery of a final report to the client

## Dataset
The dataset includes Instacart customer, order, and product data.  
- **Original Data:** Provided CSVs (customers, orders, products, etc.)  
- **Prepared Data:** Cleaned and processed CSV and PKL files
